# GGPI - Geegaz's Prop Interaction
A utility datapack for mapmakers, aiming to give a quick and intuitive way to place 3D models in a minecraft world.

## Datapack
GGPI relies on a main datapack (the repository you're viewing) to actually place models. 
This datapack adds 2 items, one for placing props and the other to erase props. To get them, use
```
/loot give @s loot geegaz:ggpi/items/prop_placer
/loot give @s loot geegaz:ggpi/items/prop_eraser
```

### Prop Placer
To place a prop, use the Prop Placer with the prop in the other hand.
- **Right click:** place prop
- **Shift-Right click:** place prop aligned to the block

### Prop Eraser
To erase a prop, aim at a prop and use the Prop Eraser. Note that a prop's hitbox is usually located around the bottom of the model.

If you made a mistake and erased the wrong prop, you can undo the last erases by shift-clicking with the Prop Eraser. Your last erases are forgotten if you leave the world / server.
- **Right click:** erase prop
- **Shift-Right click:** undo erase prop

## Props Packs
However, this datapack has no use without props packs. It's possible to create your own from scratch, but it's more of a pain for what it's worth when there is a [template pack]() available !
